_Description: Install gwhois as a whois proxy server?
 If gwhois is installed as a whois proxy server (using inetd) it
 will listen on the standard whois port (43) allowing normal
 whois clients to query it.
 .
 This can be interesting for example if you want to setup a generic whois
 server for your company or coworkers which can then use their standard
 whois-client (e.g. a windows client) and still make use of the intelligent
 features of gwhois.

_Description: Inetd or compatible replacement not installed.
 You configured gwhois to act as a whois proxy server. This
 requires inetd or a compatible replacement (in particular the
 'update-inetd' binary) which was not found.
 .
 Please install a package providing inet-superserver and
 reconfigure gwhois or disable proxy operation.
